# Top 10 Hidden Beaches in Siargao You Must Visit

Siargao is famous for Cloud 9, but the island hides countless secret beaches that will blow your mind. With your scooter from Palm Riders, you can explore these hidden gems at your own pace.

## 1. Secret Beach (Maasin)

Located in the northern part of Siargao, this beach is accessible only by a bumpy road that most tourists avoid. The reward? Crystal-clear turquoise waters, zero crowds, and the most stunning sunset you'll ever see.

**How to get there:** 45-minute ride from General Luna. Take the road to Maasin and ask locals for "Secret Beach" - they'll point you in the right direction!

## 2. Pacifico Beach

While not entirely hidden, Pacifico is often overlooked by tourists rushing to Cloud 9. This massive stretch of white sand offers powerful waves, perfect for intermediate surfers, and spectacular views.

**Best time to visit:** Early morning (6-8 AM) for the best light and fewer people.

## 3. Alegria Beach

A local favorite! This beach has a unique rock formation that creates natural pools during low tide. Perfect for families and those who want a calm swimming experience.

**Pro tip:** Bring snorkeling gear - the marine life here is incredible!

## 4. Daku Island White Sand Beach

Accessible by boat or during extreme low tide by scooter, Daku Island offers pristine white sand and some of the best seafood on the island. The grilled fish and garlic rice here are legendary.

**Don't miss:** The fresh coconut juice served right on the beach!

## 5. Magpupungko Tidal Pools

Not exactly a beach, but these natural rock pools are absolutely magical. Visit during low tide (check the tide schedule) to swim in crystal-clear natural pools surrounded by rock formations.

**Timing is everything:** Go 2 hours before low tide for the best experience.

## 6. Tayangban Cave Pool

A hidden freshwater pool inside a cave! After a day of saltwater surfing, this freshwater swim is incredibly refreshing. The cave has stunning stalactites and the water is so clear you can see fish swimming.

**Entrance fee:** ₱50 per person

## 7. Union Beach

A quiet alternative to the busy Cloud 9 area. Great for beginners learning to surf, with gentle waves and a laid-back vibe. Several small cafes offer fresh smoothies and local food.

**Sunset alert:** The sunsets here are absolutely spectacular!

## 8. Pilar Beach

The most remote beach on this list, Pilar is worth the 1.5-hour ride. Completely untouched, with dramatic cliffs, powerful waves, and not a single tourist in sight.

**Important:** Fill up your scooter with gas before heading here - there are no gas stations nearby!

## 9. Sugba Lagoon

While technically a lagoon, this spot deserves mention. The emerald green waters surrounded by limestone cliffs create a surreal landscape. Kayaking, paddleboarding, and cliff jumping are popular here.

**Booking required:** Book a tour the day before, as spots fill up quickly.

## 10. Kantolyo Beach (Guyam Island)

A tiny island with a palm tree right in the center - it looks like a cartoon paradise! The beach is small but perfect for photos and a quick swim. The surrounding waters are perfect for snorkeling.

**Photo tip:** Bring a drone for epic aerial shots!

## Essential Tips for Beach Hopping

1. **Start early:** Beat the heat and the crowds by starting at sunrise
2. **Bring water:** Stay hydrated in the tropical heat
3. **Pack light:** Just essentials - towel, sunscreen, water, snacks
4. **Respect nature:** Take all your trash with you
5. **Ask locals:** They know the best spots and can give you insider tips

# Complete Scooter Maintenance Guide: Keep Your Rental Running Smooth

While we maintain our scooters perfectly, knowing basic checks helps ensure your ride stays smooth throughout your rental. Here's what you need to know.

## Pre-Ride Inspection (Daily Check)

### Every Morning Before Riding

**Takes only 3 minutes!**

### 1. Tires (MOST IMPORTANT!)

**Check for:**
- Visible damage (cuts, bulges)
- Flat spots
- Pressure (should feel firm when pressed)
- Tread depth

**What to do:**
- ✅ Firm and no damage = Good to go!
- ❌ Soft or damaged = Call us immediately

**Why it matters:** Proper tires = safety + fuel efficiency

### 2. Brakes

**Test both brakes:**
- Front brake lever (right hand)
- Rear brake pedal (right foot)

**Should feel:**
- Firm resistance
- Smooth operation
- Scooter stops within 2 meters at low speed

**If spongy or loose:** Call us before riding

### 3. Lights

**Check all lights work:**
- Headlight (low and high beam)
- Taillight
- Brake lights (both front and rear brake)
- Turn signals (left and right)

**Test during pickup** - we check with you!

### 4. Mirrors

**Ensure:**
- Both mirrors attached
- Properly adjusted
- Clean and visible
- Not cracked

**Adjustment:** Sitting on scooter, see behind clearly

### 5. Horn

**Quick honk test:**
- Should be loud and clear
- Works immediately when pressed

**Why:** Essential for safety in traffic

### 6. Kickstand

**Check:**
- Returns to up position smoothly
- Holds scooter stable when down
- Not bent or damaged

**Safety tip:** Scooter won't start if kickstand is down (safety feature)

## Fuel Management

### Understanding Your Fuel Gauge

**Full tank indicator:**
- Needle at "F"
- ~4 liters capacity
- Range: ~150-200 km

**Half tank:**
- Needle at middle
- ~100 km range remaining

**Low fuel (time to refill):**
- Needle near "E"
- ~30 km range left
- Fill up ASAP!

### Where to Get Gas

**General Luna:**
- Shell Station (main road)
- Caltex (near market)
- Small stations (various)

**Other Towns:**
- Dapa (several stations)
- Del Carmen (limited)
- Pilar (one station)

**Cost:** ~₱60-70 per liter

### Fuel-Saving Tips

1. **Smooth acceleration** - Don't gun it!
2. **Steady speed** - Avoid constant speed changes
3. **Lighter load** - Pack only essentials
4. **Proper tire pressure** - Check regularly
5. **Turn off when stopped** - At beach, restaurant

**Average consumption:**
- City riding: 35-40 km/L
- Highway: 40-45 km/L
- With passenger: 30-35 km/L

### Emergency Fuel Situations

**If you run out:**
1. Push scooter to side of road
2. Call us: +63 945 701 4440
3. We'll bring fuel or assistance
4. Most locals can help too!

**Prevention:**
- Fill up when at 1/4 tank
- Know where gas stations are
- Carry extra ₱500 for fuel

## During Your Ride

### Things to Monitor

**Engine sounds:**
- ✅ Smooth humming = normal
- ⚠️ Knocking/rattling = call us

**Handling:**
- ✅ Smooth steering = normal
- ⚠️ Pulling to one side = tire issue
- ❌ Wobbling = stop immediately

**Brakes:**

**Call us if:**

## Storage & Parking Care

### Daytime Parking

**Best practices:**
1. **Shade when possible** - keeps seat cooler
2. **Lock steering** - turn left, turn key
3. **Kickstand on firm ground** - not in sand
4. **Face uphill** - if on slope

- Take a photo of location (if new area)

**Never:**
- Leave key in ignition
- Leave valuables visible

## Weather Protection

### Sun Exposure

**Park in shade when possible:**
- Seat won't burn you
- Protects plastic parts
- Better for battery
- More comfortable when you return

**If no shade:**
- Cover seat with towel
- Park so seat faces away from sun

### Rain

**If caught in rain:**
1. Wait it out (usually 20-30 min)
2. Use poncho to cover seat
3. Ride slowly after rain (slippery!)

**After rain:**
- Wipe down seat
- Check brakes (squeeze gently to dry)
- Clean mirrors
- Be extra careful riding

## Basic Troubleshooting

### Won't Start

1. Kickstand is UP
2. Holding brake lever
3. Key fully turned to ON
4. Kill switch is OFF
